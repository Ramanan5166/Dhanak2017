        <span id="span">O</span>ver the years, as Dhanak has grown and become more self-sufficient, it has started to impart help to the society in better ways. Nirmaan, the society of IIST that works in the domain of social betterment throughout the year, may it be by weekly visiting various government schools, by visiting and contributing to orphanages, or by holding cleanliness drives and many more such similar activities. Dhanak Social works in conjunction with the society by giving needed support to bring about more significant changes. Last year, Dhanak Social adopted a school in rural Kerala and contributed to the installation of basic facilities and betterment of the infrastructure in its own capacity by the money raised through the festival ventures.</p>

            <h2>Suggestions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Use earphones with built in microphone for recording.</li>
                <li>Audio recording software (like Audacity) can be used for recording. They come with whole lot of features to help while recording.</li>
                <li>Allow a buffer time of 5 seconds in the audio file before the actual recording matter.</li>
                <li>The language used (for general topics)should be easy to understand and should include commonly used words.</li>
                <li>Please provide us the content of the recording in a text document. This might be used to re-record the content in case there’s some issue in the recording provided to us.</li>
                <li>A formal introduction about the speaker can be provided either in the recording or the text document. However, one can submit the recording anonymously too.</li>
                <li>We here at IIST value your time and hence suggest to keep the recording under 10 minutes. However, there’s no strict upper cap on the time of recording. For longer recordings we suggest breaking the recordings into multiple parts which will be convenient for both the speaker and the listeners.</li>
            </ol>
